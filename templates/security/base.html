<!-- This base file will extend the base file for the login and register pages in order to
have the same design. Why we should have another base file here? In Flask Security by default
the files for the login and the register pages are in another folder, called with this name -
"security". To have the same design, we should extend our in-folder base page with the out-folder
one, called "security_base". -->
